# mikrotik-rs 📟

This Rust library provides an asynchronous interface to interact with the Mikrotik Command Line Interface (CLI) API.

## Features 🌟

- **Asynchronous** 🕒: Built on top of the Tokio runtime, this library offers non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Actor Pattern** 🎭: Implements an actor pattern for robust and organized handling of command execution and response retrieval.
- **Concurrent Commands** 🚦: Supports running multiple Mikrotik commands concurrently, with each command and its response efficiently managed via dedicated channels.
- **Error Handling** ⚠️: Designed with error handling in mind, ensuring that network or parsing errors are gracefully handled and reported back to the caller.

## Getting Started 🚀

To use this library in your project, first, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mikrotik-rust-async = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Ensure you have Tokio set up in your project as the library relies on the Tokio runtime.

### Basic Usage 📖

```rust
use mikrotik_rs::{command::CommandBuilder, device::MikrotikDevice};
use tokio;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the MikrotikClient 🤖 with the router's address and access credentials
    let device = MikrotikDevice::connect("192.168.122.144:8728", "admin", Some("admin")).await?;

    // Execute a command 📝
    let get_system_res = CommandBuilder::new()
        .command("/system/resource/print")
        // Send the update response every 1 second
        .attribute("interval", Some("1"))
        .build();
    let response_channel = device.send_command(get_system_res).await;

    // Listen for the command's response 🔊
    while let Some(res) = response_channel.recv().await {
        println!(">> Get System Res Response {:?}", res);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
